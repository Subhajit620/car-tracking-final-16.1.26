        <h2>About Our Platform</h2>

        <p>
            The Car Tracking System is a modern GPS-based solution that allows vehicle owners
            to track, monitor, and secure their vehicles in real time. Accurate location,
            vehicle status, and driver details are displayed on a secure dashboard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each vehicle is connected with a GPS device sending continuous location data.
            Owners can view the exact latitude, longitude, and last updated time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Security is a key priority. Encrypted passwords and session-based authentication
            ensure owners access only their vehicles. The system guarantees data privacy
            and reliability.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ideal for personal owners, fleet management, transport services, and logistics companies.
            Enhance safety, reduce risks, and improve operational control with real-time insights.
